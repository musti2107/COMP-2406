Difficulties: I had no difficulty doing question 1 and 2 on my own with cross referencing 
                           what was already done in the assignment previously and a link and label easy help form the TA. 
                          What was really bothered me was question 3. Figuring out how to update the usernames on the pages 
                          with the newusername was a challenge but with the help of the TA and my collaborators we achieved our goal.
